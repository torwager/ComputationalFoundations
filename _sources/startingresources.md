# Some resources

## Basic background
Jeanette Mumford has a great series of videos on regression (and other series too, on mixed effects, fMRI)

[Basic statistics terminology](https://youtu.be/apt8uAgtgdY) This video gently introduces some of the key concepts that provide the foundation for statistics.  

[Simple Linear Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLgPpmXVVbs) This video explains how a regression works using a single variable.  

[Matrix Algebra Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkZj8QoYjq8) This video provides the background linear algebra needed for understanding the GLM.  

[Multiple Linear Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdOG7YMolmA) This video explains how multiple regression works using linear algebra.  

[Hypothesis Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULeg3DH3g9w) This video covers the basics of hypothesis testing.  

[Contrasts in Linear Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLgPpmXVVbs&t=631s) This video provides an overview of how to test hypotheses using contrasts in the context of the GLM.  

[Interpreting Regression Parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uClfe4pLrCo) This video covers how to interpret the results from a regression analysis.  

[Mean Centering Regressors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4S576j90N8) This video covers a more subtle detail of why you might consider mean centering your continuous regression variables.

## Probability distributions

We won't cover these extensively, but it would be good to integrate in the future:

# Choosing a statistical test

Here is a guide to choosing a statistical test in the classic way, courtesy of the University of Colorado, Boulder psychology stats instructors:

You can use a GLM for all of these tests, and more complex designs as well. Here's a re-do of this breaking it down by (1) Whether there are correlated errors or not, and (2) Whether you need a link function to link the linear model to outcomes.

Here's a reorganization of statistical tests that are all examples of a GLM with uncorrelated errors.
